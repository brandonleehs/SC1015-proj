# SC1015 Mini-Project
This is the SC1015 mini project for Team2, Lab Group FCEE

## About
We will be focusing within the realm of heart disease and its associated diagnostic biomarkers for our project.
We will be utilising the [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) by David Lapp on Kaggle for our project purposes.

## Problem definition
Given diagnostic biomarkers for a patient, are we able to accurately identify if a patient has heart disease or not?

## Project Walkthrough
For a detailed walkthrough of our project, we recommend viewing our notebooks in the following order
[data-extraction-and-cleaning] ()
[data-visualisation-and-eda] ()
[decision-tree] ()
[random-forest] ()
[logistic-regression] ()
[conclusion] ()

Based on our Exploratory Data Analysis, we come up with a few hypothesis on what may be important predictors of heart_disease
We will compare our hypothesis against the results of what the machine learning models determines are important predictors of heart_disease.
We will also explore whether attaining an extremely high accuracy with our machine learning models given a patient's diagnostic biomarkers is possible.
