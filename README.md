# SC1015 Mini-Project
This is the SC1015 mini project for Team2, Lab Group FCEE

## About
We will be focusing within the realm of heart disease and its associated diagnostic biomarkers for our project.\
We will be utilising the [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) by David Lapp on Kaggle for our project purposes.

## Problem definition
Given diagnostic biomarkers for a patient, are we able to accurately identify if a patient has heart disease or not?

## Project Walkthrough
For a detailed walkthrough of our project, we recommend viewing our notebooks in the following order:\
1. [data-extraction-and-cleaning](https://github.com/brandonleehs/SC1015-proj/blob/cvd/data-extraction-and-cleaning.ipynb)\
2. [data-visualisation-and-eda](https://github.com/brandonleehs/SC1015-proj/blob/cvd/data-visualisation-and-eda.ipynb)\
3. [decision-tree](https://github.com/brandonleehs/SC1015-proj/blob/cvd/decision-tree.ipynb)\
4. [random-forest](https://github.com/brandonleehs/SC1015-proj/blob/cvd/random-forest.ipynb)\
5. [logistic-regression](https://github.com/brandonleehs/SC1015-proj/blob/cvd/logistic-regression.ipynb)\
6. [conclusion](To Be Added)\

Based on our Exploratory Data Analysis, we come up with a few hypothesis on what may be important predictors of heart_disease\
We will compare our hypothesis against the results of what the machine learning models determines are important predictors of heart_disease.\
We will also explore whether attaining an extremely high accuracy with our machine learning models given a patient's diagnostic biomarkers is possible.
